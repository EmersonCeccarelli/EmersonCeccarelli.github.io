### Dataset: San Francisco Plant Finder

**URL:**  
[San Francisco Plant Finder Data (DataSF)](https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih/about_data)

This dataset powers the [SF Plant Finder](https://sfplanninggis.org/plantsf/) — a city resource that recommends climate-appropriate, habitat-building plants for San Francisco’s microclimates. The site notes the data is downloadable under a Creative Commons license and maintained by City agencies supporting biodiversity and climate resilience.

- **What it covers:** Curated list of recommended plants used by SF Plant Finder (City resources describe filters like sun exposure, plant type, habitat/water use).  
- **Why it’s useful:** Links planting choices to goals like biodiversity, urban heat mitigation, and water conservation.  
- **Last updated (portal inventory):** July 10, 2025.

**Potential applications**
>I am always looking at the plants I see when I walk around town, and the first thing I always think is, 'is that a native plant?'
>
This dataset could be extremely useful to determine if plants are native or not and how that might translate to effective pollination within their natural community.
