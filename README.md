### Dataset: San Francisco Plant Finder

**URL:** [San Francisco Plant Finder Data (DataSF)](https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih/about_data)

This dataset powers the [SF Plant Finder](https://sfplanninggis.org/plantsf/) — a city resource that recommends climate-appropriate, habitat-building plants for San Francisco’s microclimates. The site notes the data is downloadable under a Creative Commons license and maintained by City agencies supporting biodiversity and climate resilience.

- **What it covers:** Curated list of recommended plants used by SF Plant Finder (City resources describe filters like sun exposure, plant type, habitat/water use).  
- **Why it’s useful:** Links planting choices to goals like biodiversity, urban heat mitigation, and water conservation.  

**Potential applications**
>I am always looking at the plants I see when I walk around town, and the first thing I always think is, 'is that a native plant?'
>

This dataset could be extremely useful to determine if plants are native or not and how that might translate to effective pollination within their natural community.



### Book: **Fundamental Numerical Methods and Data Analysis**  

**URL:** [Fundamental Numerical Methods and Data Analysis](https://ads.harvard.edu/books/1990fnmd.book/)

*A practical tour of numerical tools used in data science: linear systems, interpolation, numerical differentiation/integration, ODE solvers, least-squares & Fourier analysis, and sampling distributions. Directly useful for regression, FFT/spectral analysis, and uncertainty estimation.*

- **Author:** George W. Collins, II 
- **Institute:** Harvard University 

>This book looks strangley comforting to me; I always enjoyed my 'blocky' math books and especially enjoy Linear Algebra and Number Theory so anything 'Numeric' always catches my eye. I think this book, while recreationaly interesting, would be quite difficult to pull out useful analysis of uncertainty within the scope of this exercise.
